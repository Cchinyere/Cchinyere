I am an Information Security and Cyber Risk professional with experience across security operations, incident management, governance, risk and compliance (GRC), business continuity, and security awareness training within regulated environments.

My work focuses on applying international standards and practical security principles to real organisational challenges. I build artefacts that reflect how security is governed, operated, and assured in practice, rather than theoretical or lab-based exercises.

What I focus on

Enterprise cyber risk management
Identifying, assessing, and treating cyber risk in a way that supports business objectives, regulatory obligations, and informed decision-making.

ISO/IEC 27001 & ISMS governance
Conducting gap analysis, developing compliance roadmaps, producing audit-ready evidence, and designing security policy and governance frameworks.

Incident management & security operations
Managing the incident lifecycle, supporting detection and response activities, capturing lessons learned, and strengthening operational resilience.

Security awareness training
Designing and delivering security awareness initiatives and phishing simulations to reduce human risk and improve secure behaviour across the organisation.

Third-party & supplier cyber risk
Assessing supplier security posture, data protection risk, and contractual controls to manage third-party exposure effectively.

Business continuity & resilience
Supporting continuity planning, incident preparedness, and recovery governance to maintain critical services during disruption.

How I work

I take a risk-based and proportionate approach, focusing on:

Clear ownership and accountability

Practical controls that can be implemented and evidenced

Communication that works for both technical teams and senior stakeholders

Governance structures that stand up to audit and assurance

What this GitHub represents

This GitHub showcases applied, audit-ready security and GRC work, including:
