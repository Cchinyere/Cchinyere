I am an Information Security and Cyber Risk professional with experience spanning security operations, incident management, governance, risk and compliance (GRC), and business continuity across regulated and public-sector–aligned environments.

My work focuses on applying international standards and practical security principles to real organisational challenges. I build artefacts that reflect how security is governed, operated, and assured in practice, not theoretical or lab-based exercises.

What I focus on

Enterprise cyber risk management – identifying, assessing, and treating risk in a way that supports business and regulatory decision-making

ISO/IEC 27001 & ISMS governance – gap analysis, compliance roadmaps, audit-ready evidence, and policy frameworks

Incident management & security operations – incident lifecycle management, detection and response, lessons learned, and operational resilience

Third-party & supplier cyber risk – assessing supplier security posture, data protection risk, and contractual controls

Business continuity & resilience – supporting continuity planning, incident preparedness, and recovery governance

How I work

I take a risk-based, proportionate approach, focusing on:

Clear ownership and accountability

Practical controls that can be implemented and evidenced

Communication that works for both technical teams and senior stakeholders

Governance structures that stand up to audit and assurance

What this GitHub represents

This GitHub showcases applied, audit-ready security and GRC work, including:

Enterprise cyber risk assessments

ISO/IEC 27001 gap analysis and compliance roadmaps

All projects are aligned with international standards and UK regulatory expectations, reflecting how security is delivered in real organisations..
